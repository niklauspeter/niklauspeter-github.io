        <p>Contrary to some commonly ill perceived beliefs, this guy, Klaus Orioki is <strong> not</strong> a vampire, NO."I am actualy quite laidback, reserved, quiet but still incredibly witty individual", says he."
        <p>"And no, unlike the character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Morgan_(actor)">Niklaus Michaelson </a> from the originals,
           i do <strong>NOT</strong> drink blood in order to survive. Instead, i wanna be a software developer.</p>
        <p> I'm currently learning code at <a href="https://www.moringaschool.com/">Moringa school</a>".</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
         My educational background is not quite so different from that of the typical african boy-child. I was subjected to the same monotonous, ill defined 8-4-4 system.
         Performed slightly a bit more than a little bit above average in my KCPE exams, after which i joined high school.
         After completing my secondary school education in kagumo high school in Nyeri, i proceded to join Jommo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
         where i completed a four year bachelors program and aquired a degree in business information technology.
         <p>During the period i got to work as an intern in gift computers, a computer repair organisation based in karen town, Nairobi. Where i can confidently claim to have aquired invaluable knowledge
        about the inner workings of the hardware
         elements of computers and computer related electronics. I also did part time free-lance writing during the time.</p>
         <P>This exposure to this kind of environment motivated me to wanna know even more about how the computer is programmed, a lesson i felt i barely covered in campus.
          which is why, after a couple of recommendations from close counterparts on enquiry, i chose to join moringa school.</p>
          <span class="list">
          <h3><strong>A list of other things i'm good at</strong></h3>
            <ol>

              <li>Dancing fairly decently above average</li>
              <li>Attempting but more often than not, failing miserably at comedy</li>
              <li>Writing poetry</li>
              <li>Saying "hi my name is Klaus"</li>
              <li>Staring really hard into the eyes of the beholder</li>
            </ol>
          </span>
            <p>Currently, other than my interest in computer programming , i enjoy literature in its different forms, including the writing poetry and reading it, or simply indulging both fictional and non-fictional books.
          I also <span class="color"><em>attempt to partake</em></span> in practicing the lost art of meditation
          ever so often.<span class="altcol"><em>never quite known if i do it right</em></span> but i believe simply trying to meditate and deploying the different recommended breathing techniques, helps in aquiring
          some level mental health,<span class="color"><em> a commonly underrated yet fundamental requirement for human living</em></span>. I enjoy good music, going as far as expressing myself through break dancing <span class="altcol"><em>though i can't really say i'm actually good at it ... yet</em></span>.
            <p>i am open minded to try many more things and, as much as i possibly can, stretch the limits of my human mind, <span class="color">and possibly even maybe aquire supernatural abilities like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender"> the avatar</a></span><p>
