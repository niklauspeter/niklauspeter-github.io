        <p>"And no, unlike the character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Morgan_(actor)">niklaus michaelson </a> from the originals,
           i do <strong>NOT</strong> drink blood in order to survive. Instead, i wanna be a software developer.</p>
        <p> I'm currently learning code at <a href="https://www.moringaschool.com/">Moringa school</a>".</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         My educational background is quite not so different from the typical african boy-child. i was subjected to the same monotonous, ill defined 8-4-4 system.
         performed slightly a bit more than a little bit above average in my kcpe, after which i joined high school.
         After completing my secondary school education in kagumo high school in Nyeri, i proceded to join Jommo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
         where i completed a four year bachelors program and aquired a degree in business information technology.
        <p>During the period i got to work as an intern in gift computers, a computer repair organisation based in karen town in nairobi. Where i can confidently claim to have aquired invaluable knowledge
        about the inner workings of the hardware elements of computers and computer related electronics. I also did part time free-lance writing during the time.</p>
        <P>This exposure to this kind of environment motivated me to wanna know even more about how the computer is programmed, a lesson i felt i barely covered in campus.
          which is why, after a couple of recommendations from close counterparts on enquiry, i chose to join moringa school.</p>
        <p>Currently, other than my interest in computer programming , i enjoy literature in its different forms, including the writing poetry and reading it, or simply indulging both fictional and non-fictional books.
          I also <em>attempt to partake</em> in practicing the lost art of meditation
          ever so often.<em>never quite known if i do it right</em> but i believe simply trying to meditate and deploying the different recommended breathing techniques, helps in aquiring
          some level mental health,<em> a commonly underrated yet fundamental requirement for human living</em>. I enjoy good music, going as far as expressing myself through break dancing <em>though i can't really say i'm actually good at it ... yet</em>.
          <p>i am open minded to try many more things and as much as i possibly can, stretch the limits of my human mind, and possibly even maybe aquire supernatural abilities like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender"> the avatar</a><p>

      <ol>
        <p><strong>below is a list of things i'm also good at</strong></p>
        <li>dancing fairly decently above average</li>
          <li>attempting but more often than not failing miserably at comedy</li>
            <li>writing poetry</li>
              <li>saying "hi my name is Klaus"</li>
